# EPIC-TIDE / NTC-VPC v2.0.0

**Evidence-Powered Iterative Coordination through Tensor Intelligence-Driven Execution**

A platform for autonomous AI coordination, operating within the **GEM² mathematical universe**.

---

## Overview

**EPIC-TIDE** is an AI-native software development platform in which autonomous AI actors execute development tasks within formally defined and verifiable boundaries.

This repository contains the **public conceptual specification** of EPIC-TIDE and its **NTC-VPC protocol**, establishing priority, terminology, and design intent.  
It is **not an implementation** and does not expose operational internals.

## Conceptual Stack (Read This First)

```
GEM² Universe   → Mathematical workspace (theory)
EPIC-TIDE      → Autonomous AI development platform
NTC-VPC        → Specification & execution protocol
```

- **GEM²** defines what it means for a system to exist, converge, and complete
- **EPIC-TIDE** applies GEM² to AI-driven software construction
- **NTC-VPC** defines how specifications are expressed and verified

This separation is intentional and foundational.

## Core Principle

> **“Humans dream, AI delivers, Evidence decides.”**

EPIC-TIDE replaces time-based planning with **evidence-based convergence**.  
Progress is determined by what is *proven*, not how long something took.

## Key Concepts (High Level)

### GEM² (Mathematical Foundation)

Systems are evaluated within two superimposed fields:

| Field | Interpretation | Human-facing meaning |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| **U_e** (Existence) | Discrete | What structure exists |
| **U_r** (Resistance) | Continuous | Entropy, friction, bugs |

**Completion condition**:  
All required existence is present ∧ all resistance converges to minimum.

> GEM² is defined formally in the GEM² Universe whitepaper.  
> This README uses human-facing interpretations only.

### Mandate vs Trajectory

| Mandate (M) | Trajectory (T) |
|------------|---------------|
| WHAT must be true | HOW it was achieved |
| Defined by humans | Decided by AI |
| Formally verifiable | Opaque but reviewable via evidence |

AI has autonomy **only within mandate boundaries**.

---

### Evidence Replaces Time

```
Traditional: Progress = f(time)
EPIC-TIDE:   Progress = f(Evidence)
```

Time estimates are irrelevant.  
Only entropy reduction and verification matter.

---

## Phase Model

```
CHAOS → STABILIZING → CRYSTALLIZING → GEM STATE
```

These phases describe **convergence**, not workflow steps.

## Final Notes

- GEM² = mathematical universe  
- EPIC-TIDE = platform  
- NTC-VPC = protocol  

They are related — **not interchangeable**.
