# EPIC-TIDE / NTC-VPC v2.6.0

**Evidence-Powered Iterative Coordination through Tensor Intelligence-Driven Execution**

A **public exposition** of a methodology for autonomous AI software development operating within the **GEM² Universe**.

> **Public edition (No-IP-Leak):** This README intentionally stays at the **conceptual layer**. It does **not** disclose equations, thresholds, operator chains, internal data structures, or implementation details.

## Overview

> **“GEMsquared.ai is building GEM²: the mathematical universe for autonomous software development. We replace heuristic agent behavior with provable, physics-based execution boundaries.”**

**EPIC-TIDE** describes how autonomous AI actors execute software work inside a constrained universe where:

* progress is measured by **evidence**, not time
* autonomy is allowed only inside **explicit boundaries**
* completion is defined as **realistic convergence** (tolerance), not perfection

This repository exists to establish **priority, terminology, and design intent** for EPIC-TIDE and its governing specification, **NTC-VPC**.

**Not included here:** operational code, orchestration systems, internal protocols, platform internals, private thresholds, or any deployable artifacts.

## Canonical Naming (Locked)

Use these names consistently. They are related — **never interchangeable**.

* **Company (Legal):** GEMsquared.ai
* **Brand:** GEM²
* **Platform:** GEM² Platform
* **Universe:** GEM² Universe
* **Methodology (Internal / Specification):** EPIC-TIDE
* **Specification Layer:** NTC-VPC

> **One-sentence mental model:** GEM² defines the universe, the GEM² Platform executes within it, EPIC-TIDE governs the dynamics, and NTC-VPC enforces the conservation laws.

## Core Principle

> **“Humans dream, AI delivers, Evidence decides.”**

* **Human** defines the mandate (what must be true)
* **AI** chooses the trajectory (how it gets there)
* **Evidence** determines whether the mandate has been satisfied

EPIC-TIDE replaces time-based planning with **evidence-based convergence**.

## Public Conceptual Model (High-Level)

### 1) Dual-Universe Evaluation

Systems are evaluated through two complementary lenses:

* **Existence:** what is verified to work
* **Resistance:** what fails, degrades, or remains uncertain

A component can simultaneously show strong existence while still carrying resistance. The system is considered “complete enough” when existence is sufficient and resistance falls below acceptable tolerance.

### 2) Mandate vs. Trajectory

* **Mandate:** the human-defined truth conditions (what must be true)
* **Trajectory:** the AI-determined path taken to satisfy those conditions

The path is not prescribed. It is evaluated **after the fact** through evidence.

### 3) Autonomy Gate

There is a clean boundary between:

* **pre-gate:** human + AI shaping constraints and acceptance criteria
* **post-gate:** AI executes autonomously; human becomes a reviewer/observer

This “one-way door” prevents continual goal-post shifting and keeps autonomy mathematically bounded.

### 4) Bounded Decomposition

Complex systems are decomposed into bounded components and bounded dependency maps. The goal is to keep complexity within human-auditable limits while still allowing scalable AI execution.
