# EPIC-TIDE/NTC-VPC v2.0.0

**Evidence-Powered Iterative Coordination through Tensor Intelligence-Driven Execution**

A platform for autonomous AI coordination with GEM² mathematical foundation.

---

## Overview

EPIC-TIDE is a software development framework where AI actors autonomously execute development tasks within mathematically verifiable boundaries. It introduces a novel approach to human-AI collaboration based on formal specification and evidence-based progress tracking.

### Core Innovation

> *"Humans dream, AI delivers, Evidence decides"*

- **GEM²** (Grounded Existence Matrix for Global Entropy Minimum) — Dual universe model for system completion verification
- **T_AI** — AI as active motivator, replacing time-based scheduling with intelligence-driven execution
- **NTC-VPC** — Unified specification (NTC) and execution (VPC) framework

## Key Concepts

### The GEM² Universe

Systems exist in two superimposed universes:

| Universe | Type | Measures |
|----------|------|----------|
| **U_e** (Existence) | Binary | Topology — what paths exist |
| **U_r** (Resistance) | Continuous | Entropy — friction/bugs in system |

**System completion** = All required U_e exists ∧ All U_r converges to minimum

### Framework Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NTC (Specification)                │
│  • Notation — How to write          │
│  • Topology — What structure        │
│  • Contract — What agreement        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  VPC (Execution)                    │
│  • Verification — Is it correct     │
│  • Process — How to work            │
│  • Coordination — Who does what     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  GEM² (Completion)                  │
│  • Evidence-based progress          │
│  • Entropy convergence metrics      │
│  • Phase transition model           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase States

```
CHAOS → STABILIZING → CRYSTALLIZING → GEM STATE
  ☆         ∼              ◇            ◇

## Philosophy

### Mandate vs Trajectory Separation

| Mandate (M) | Trajectory (T) |
|-------------|----------------|
| Rigid Truth | Fluid Intelligence |
| Human defines | AI decides |
| WHAT must be true | HOW to achieve it |
| Verified by evidence | Opaque to review |

### Evidence Replaces Time

```
Traditional:   Progress = f(time)
EPIC-TIDE:     Progress = f(Evidence)
```

Time estimation is obsolete. Only entropy reduction matters.
