# EPIC-TIDE / NTC-VPC v2.6.0

**Public Specification (No‑IP‑Leak Edition)**
**Date:** 27 December 2025
**Publisher:** GEMsquared.ai

> This public edition intentionally stays at the **conceptual and narrative layer**. It does **not** disclose internal math, symbols, thresholds, state machines, operator chains, data structures, or execution mechanics.

## 1. Overview

**EPIC-TIDE** is a methodology for autonomous AI software development inside the **GEM² Universe**.

**NTC-VPC** is the specification layer that defines the **verification boundaries**: what must be true, what evidence counts, and how completion is determined.

This repository exists to establish **priority, terminology, and design intent**.

---

## 2. Why This Exists

Autonomous development fails when systems cannot answer these questions in a verifiable way:

* What, exactly, must be true?
* What evidence proves it is true?
* What remains uncertain or unstable?
* When is the system “complete enough” to ship?

EPIC-TIDE and NTC-VPC propose that autonomy should be governed by **evidence** and **bounded constraints**, not by time-based schedules or vague status reporting.

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Evidence over Time

Progress is measured by **verifiable artifacts** (tests, checks, demonstrations, audits, reproducible results), not by effort or elapsed time.

### 3.2 Mandate over Plan

Humans define the **mandate** (what must be true). AI chooses the **trajectory** (how it gets there). The path is evaluated *after execution* through evidence.

### 3.3 Bounded Autonomy

Autonomy is granted only inside explicit boundaries:

* constraints
* acceptance criteria
* allowed interfaces
* safety and security conditions

### 3.4 Completion by Tolerance

Completion is defined as:

* the mandate is satisfied, and
* remaining uncertainty/instability is below an acceptable tolerance

This enables shipping real systems without claiming perfection.

---

## 4. Conceptual Model (Public)

### 4.1 Two Concurrent Views

GEM² uses two concurrent views of a system:

* **Verified reality**: what is demonstrated to work and can be relied on
* **Residual resistance**: what still fails, degrades, remains unknown, or creates risk

Both are tracked simultaneously to avoid “false confidence” and to make remaining work explicit.

### 4.2 Autonomy Gate

A one-way boundary separates:

* **before-gate:** mandate + constraints + acceptance criteria are defined
* **after-gate:** AI executes autonomously; humans review evidence

This prevents endless goal-post shifting and keeps autonomy bounded.

### 4.3 Bounded Decomposition

Large systems are decomposed into bounded components and bounded dependency maps so that:

* humans can audit structure
* AI can execute without collapsing into global complexity

---

## 5. NTC-VPC (What It Ensures)

NTC-VPC formalizes the minimum guarantees needed for autonomous execution:

* **Provability:** every claimed progress point must be supported by evidence
* **Traceability:** every output is traceable to an explicit mandate and evidence record
* **Verifiable completion:** the system can assert completion under defined tolerance

This public edition does not disclose the internal representation of these guarantees.

---

## 6. What This Repo Is / Is Not

### This repo **is**

* a public conceptual specification
* a terminology and naming anchor
* a design-intent record

### This repo **is not**

* an implementation
* a release of private thresholds or internal states
* a disclosure of internal operators, data models, or orchestration logic
* a guide to reproduce the internal execution engine
